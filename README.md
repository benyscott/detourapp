# Navigation meets zen

Bringing travelling to your city / Discovering your neighbourhood

Detour is an app to help discover new places. It is a navigation app, a touristic guide and an events alerter, all in one.

💡 The idea originated when a friend was visiting me in London, and as we walked around I’d tell them: *“Oh! If we walk 100m down that road we can see where they shot this scene from Harry Potter”*, over and over again… 🚨 App idea alert!

No need to plan everything in advance, walk around any town as you feel, and let the app take you on mini-detours to places you might find interesting: 🏰 architectural gems, 🎬 famous movie scenes, 📚 following book characters, or the 💯 must-go places if you’re in a rush.

Find places around you that your friends like, stop sifting through 20 cafes before deciding for one, trust your friends have good taste (otherwise stop being their friends).

## 🦪 Pearls

*Places, restaurants, monuments*

Decide, or be recommended, what to see, where to go.

## ⏳ Moments

*Events, experiences*

You can physically walk through a city, but nothing beats discovering a city through events & traditions.

## 🗺️ Navigation

*Map*

Choose the experience. Point towards it. Walk… or bike.

# Zen 🧘🏼

We live in a world of “everything, everywhere, all at once”, overloaded with unnecessary information. *Let’s kick back, bring back our clean analog past to our overstimulating digital present.*

😌 Clutter-free: the UI/UX and branding is primordial. It needs to be clean, simple. Need to get to the Sagrada Familia? Detour points to it and tells you how far it is. Create your own path.

🗨️ Language: let’s be poetic and humoristic. Let’s *think different*. Points of Interest (POIs), Events and Maps are words we see everyday everywhere. Let’s rename them. POIs could be **Pearls** 🦪 (after all, the world is your oyster), Events are **Moments** ⏳ (live in the moment, baby).
